//In this file, several definitions related to networking, DBMS etc.

Encoding: In computers, encoding is the process of putting a sequence of characters (letters, numbers punctuation and certain symbols) into a 
specialized format for efficient transmission or storage.

Decoding: is the opposite process of encoding, the conversioin of an encoded format back into the original sequence of characters.
Encoding and Decoding are used in data communications, networking and storage.

Most common encoding: ASCII encoding
Other: Unicode, BinHex, MIME
Manchester Encoding: a special type of encoding in which the binary digits (bits) represent the transitions between high and low logic
states.
Morse Code: Oldest code of all, originally employed in the landline telegraph during the 19th century

Encoding should not be confused with Encryption.
In Encryption, data is deliberately altered so as to conceal its content.
Encryption can be done without changing the particular code that the content is in and Encoding can be done without deliberately 
concealing the content.

Extension of the original Internet e-mail protocol that lets people use the protocol to exchange different kinds of data files on the
Internet: audio, video, images, application programs, and other kinds, as well as the ASCII text.
