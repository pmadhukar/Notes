//This file contains my notes on Multithreading in Java.

1. Two basic ways of creating threads in Java:
a. Extend Thread Class
b. Implement Runnable interface and pass it to the constructor of the Thread class

--check
thread.start();
thread.join();

Executor Services : thread pool --Check


Basic Thread Synchronization:
If two or more thread sharing the same data, two problems may occur:
1. Data being cached
2. Thread interleaving


Volatile keyword prevents from data being cached --Check
private volatile boolean running;

synchronized keyword to prevent interleaving

Every object in Java has intrinsic lock/monitor lock/mutex --check

It's not always ideal to have just one intrinsic lock...you may want multiple locks?? --check



=============
Producer Consumer
BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<Integer>(10);//creates an array of 10 ints
BlockingQueue class is thread safe.

queue.put(intValue); //Waits if queue is full
queue.take(); //waits if queue is empty
