//Module: Object design: constructors, instance variables, methods
//Core: Overloading methods

methods can be overloaded as long as their signatures are different.
signature = parameters and method name //not return type
so to overload a method, we should provide different parameters. //because if overloading, method name will be same.

//Following is not overloading
//it's a compilation error
//because parameter list is same, only return type differs
//and return type is not considered as part of signature of the method
public int someMethod(int a){...}
public float someMethod(int a){...}
